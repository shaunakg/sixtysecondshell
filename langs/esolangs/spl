## SixtySecondShell launch script for Shakespeare Programming Language

## This file will launch a Docker container with the esolang/spl image, running spl.

# This programming language is shell-less - it does NOT come with a REPL.
# Therefore, we are using the shell-less execution runtime to load the file into the container.

# The server will pass us the file name, which we will pass to the container
