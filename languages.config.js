// Language definition config file
// Each entry in `langs` is a dict with:
//      name: human readable name presented to user. Preferably with no spaces.
//      script: bash script located relative to server.js that contains launch instructions for the language's REPL
//      description: human readable description, can include HTML.
//      image: URL to image, relative to site. If you want it hosted on the frontend, contact me.
//      hello_world: A simple "hello world" program. This will be prefilled in the editor for shellless languages. If the language has a shell, this has no effect for now.
//      args: args to pass to the script. Used for the generic_esolang script to pass the name of the language.
